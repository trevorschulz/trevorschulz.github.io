                <p>I spoke to you last night 
                    Said everything’s alright 
                    Told you I was doing something special 
                    
                    Today I got the word 
                    You didn’t deserve 
                    I hung up when I heard what happened 
                    
                    I thought I’d see you I'd see you again 
                    With a joint or a drink in your hand 
                    Now you’re covered in roses instead 
                    What would you have said 
                    What would you have said 
                    
                    Feeling like my soul’s been gravity bound 
                    And I got the city weighing me down 
                    I don’t wanna waste life waiting around 
                    For weddings and funerals 
                    
                    Used to be scared of dying alone 
                    Now I know there’s nothing to be afraid of 
                    I don’t wanna waste life waiting around 
                    For weddings and funerals 
                    
                    If you had more time 
                    You’d walk down the the aisle 
                    I know that you had somebody special 
                    
                    But no ones wearing white 
                    (We’re) Dressed in black tonight 
                    I still can’t believe what happened 
                    
                    I thought I’d see you I'd see you again 
                    With a joint or a drink in your hand
